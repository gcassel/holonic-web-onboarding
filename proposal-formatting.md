# Proposal Formatting

Proposal FormattingAuthor: [Greg Cassel](https://github.com/gcassel)Status: Alpha.  (This document will receive an open [CC 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license after it achieves sufficient stability.)\
This guide supplements [Modular Organizing Recipe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ssWfsuaKQkytdW1q83qKzEjxrY-BoreREch46JOMQY/edit?usp=sharing) and [MORDEF Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qKigOjr0yqlVt68Q3vuTp32OYEJb78EYPBN4IRJKx44/edit?usp=sharing).  Use [Basic MORDEF Formatting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FG9M\_YB3nacs1a61P8aQmlblUt40XAZ-TSWtEKw8rmw/edit?usp=sharing) along with the Resource Description sectioning suggestions below.\
IntroductionEach of the sections below can be developed inline in the proposal text, preferably with effective document sectioning.  It’s also possible to develop some sections such as Cost/Benefit analysis as linked Extensions, if responsibly stewarded and edited.\
Note that many proposals can and should be very simple, and should not use most of the structural options described below.  These options are included for major long-term proposal development.\
Proposal StructureStructure every proposal to clearly specify each and every proposed action which will, during the voting procedure, be simultaneously approved or declined by any number of [Eligible Voters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.gszywibughdu).\
Each proposal may be [Simple](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.o47cz07002uj) or [Compound](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.vosyypx8fnpl), and each proposed action may be [Enclosed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.gbjaesqogg4h) or [Linked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.htk8x2h3pdg4). \
Simple ProposalsA Simple Proposal defines only one proposed action, which may be either [Enclosed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.gbjaesqogg4h) or [Linked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.htk8x2h3pdg4).\
\
Examples:We will cancel this year’s annual gatheringAdopt the following Diversity Policy: \[text]Adopt the \[linked] Diversity Policy\
Simple Proposals can effectively address simple goals.  They can also address highly complex, unpredictable and uncertain matters, although often with debatable practicality.  [(1)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.crcfsjo8mh92)\
Compound ProposalsA Compound Proposal defines two or more proposed items, each of which may be [Enclosed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.7zap1b3rear7) or [Linked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.htk8x2h3pdg4).  Compound proposals can usually be presented as numbered or unnumbered lists.   Important note:  When a compound proposal is submitted for voting, the voters will categorically vote to approve or decline all of the items together, regardless of whether or not mutual dependencies have previously been perceived!  Therefore, think carefully about bundling any potentially contentious proposal items together into a single compound proposal, unless you’re trying to force contentious items through by means of their packaging, which Modular Governance Recipe doesn’t encourage or support.\
Examples:\
Cancel this year’s annual gatheringForm a new Gathering Committee to design next year’s gatheringAdopt the linked policy for assigning members to Gathering Committee  Adopt the following Diversity Policy: \[text]Form a new Diversity Committee to develop a Harassment and Abuse Policy, per this (linked) Diversity Committee CharterRelease this announcement to the press: \[text]\
Sequential DependenciesNumbered lists of [items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.gbjaesqogg4h) can directly specify sequential processes, when sequence matters!  When sequential dependency is present, a Compound Proposal should clearly denote that the actions must be performed in their listed order.\
Mutual DependenciesIn drafting and revising a Compound Proposal, it can be very important to indicate whether the authors and/or viewers consider the proposed actions to be mutually dependent (and, therefore, mutually required) or not.  This formal distinction is important because it affects the creative potential to substantially change or to delete any of those actions.   (Add examples.)   When mutual dependence is present, the mutually dependent actions should be clearly grouped with the denotation that “all of the below” (or above) actions must be approved or declined together, to improve the efficiency of discussion and design iteration.\
Proposal ItemsEnclosed ItemsAn Enclosed Item is fully described by its text in the Proposal Summary.  I.e., it does not depend upon the details in externally-stored Resources.\
Enclosed Items can be technically simpler than [Linked Items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.htk8x2h3pdg4), because less structure is required.  However, major and ambitious Enclosed Items may practically need the same degree of analytical design and formatting as one would apply to a linked [Subject Resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subject-resource.md), such as a fully developed Project Summary (see [Project Formatting Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vr957QAuU88YwXFXtoIrXocIDwXCtbpWWY4aRZQapXk/edit?usp=sharing)).  \
Linked ItemsA Linked Item is formally related to a [Subject Resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subject-resource.md).  The Subject Resource should be linked either directly or by means of a Resource Description.  Precisely specify the proposal item in reference to the linked Subject.  (For example, adding or removing that Subject to the Base Project, or replacing another Resource with the Subject; etcetera).\
The development of a Subject Resource, which could be included in one or more Linked Items, can improve clarity and efficiency in any major, long-term research and development processes.\
Proposal Item FormattingTo effectively and sufficiently describe each proposal item, use the basic guidelines below:\
Subject and Predicate Structure: Each proposal item should indicate a subject and a predicate, indicating a person or persons (subject) who will support a resource or perform an action (predicate).\
The subject may be indicated for a clearly-contained grouping of actions all at once; for example:  “Team X will take the following actions:  \[Action 1], \[Action 2], \[Action 3].\
Predicates/proposed actions often represent offers or requests; however, they can be any type of possible action.  The predicate verb (the proposed action) should be in future or present tense. \
Precisely define the object of the predicate if (1) there is a definable object and (2) the object is not implicitly clear.\
Example:  “We will go to the Apple Festival” because the object of the action go is definitively important, or “We will go to the Shellsbury Apple Festival” to be clear about which apple festival we’re going to.)\
Conciseness and Clarity:  Use a single sentence, if feasible, to fully indicate each of the proposed actions.\
Keep all intended relationships and meanings as clear, simple, and unambiguous (and easy to remember!) as possible.  \
If an action is too complex to represent in a single sentence, consider creating and linking a Subject Resource which describes a specific Plan.\
Additionally, for highly subtle or challenging proposed actions, it can be helpful to provide one or more paraphrased versions of each action.  If so, each paraphrased version must be fully compatible with the intention of the proposal.\
Time Frame:  The proposed action should specify an acceptable time frame (earliest and latest time to perform it) in any case where it’s not implicit, and seems important.\
For example, there is probably no need to specify the time frame for “go to the annual Apple Festival” if all the voters know when that is.  (Be careful with assumptions, however.)\
Complex Proposal ExampleProject A will perform the following actions:Fundraising and BudgetingRaise $10,000 by February 13, 2023.Hire one person to fill this Role: \[Fundraiser Role Summary]Develop and establish its 2024 budget by August 1, 2023.Replace the current charter of Subproject X with \[Subproject X Charter 2.0]Add the following Accountability to \[Role 1]: “Prepare marketing videos for team review on a weekly basis, per \[Marketing Video Specification].”\
Eligible VotersYou should clearly specify each and every eligible voter and/or category of eligible voters, except in the following conditions:\
it’s an [Open Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.l9xgmvzdnydp) it’s an [Extension Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.siskvc3gwibt) which is clearly subordinate to a specific projectall of the eligible voters are demonstrably aware of who is eligible, and why\
Per point #3 above and [Asynchronous Decision Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15t1QYFv0FQAsbpP7N5zKV8ql9HOfuKbERQJr9vGbROs/edit?usp=sharing) (which is optional here), it’s crucial for eligible voters to understand why they and other voters are eligible.\
Specifying eligible individual voters:  Specify them, as appropriate, by personal name or by the relevant title of a role in a specific project.\
Specifying categories of voters:  Specify them, as appropriate, through any unique trait or combination of traits which creates their shared eligibility to vote on this Proposal.  The trait or traits can be (but doesn’t need to be) membership in a specific project, subproject or other group.\
Open ProposalsOpen Proposals are offered in one or more social contexts for adoption by any readers who consent in writing.  For instance, many petitions and pledges are openly available to the public.  Such open agreements create mild or negligible social expectations, which their creators or trustees can informally steward.  \
If your proposal is an Open Proposal, this should be implicitly or explicitly clear through its composition and the nature of its presentation; for example, publicly posting “Sign this \[linked petition]” in a large social network.\
Extension ProposalsIf this is a Proposal to add, remove or change an Extension Resource for a Base Resource which has officially assigned Stewards, the Eligible Voters are automatically the Stewards of the Base Resource.\
Stewardship can be inherited through any number of hierarchical levels of organizing Base and Extension Resources.  [(2)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.t1966dci808h)\
If you’re trying to develop a team subproject for a Base Project, you might start with an informal team which co-authors a Proposal to create a predefined team of subproject Stewards, or by authoring a Proposal which will (if successful) charter the development (including any recruitment, assignment process, etcetera) of a team.  In both cases, however, a Proposal is developed for the Base Project, and all of the Base’s Stewards are Eligible Voters.  [(3)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.65kmt4140fk7)\
All Other ProposalsMany proposals are neither [Open Proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.l9xgmvzdnydp) nor [Extension Proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.siskvc3gwibt).  (For example, proposals to start independent new team projects or personal agreements are neither Open Proposals nor Extension Proposals.)  In these other cases, you should explain (or be ready to explain!) why some people have been invited and others (i.e., the rest of the world) have not.  However, eligibility can often be defined simply, according to one or more traits which the Eligible Voters have in common, including the personal friendship or trust of the Proposal’s Stewards.\
Decision PolicyClearly define or link this Proposal’s decision-making plan, unless it’s clearly predetermined by Base Project policy.\
If the decision-making plan is not clearly predetermined by existing Project structure, feel free to directly adopt or to modify [Asynchronous Decision Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15t1QYFv0FQAsbpP7N5zKV8ql9HOfuKbERQJr9vGbROs/edit?usp=sharing), and to link it here.\
ReasonsOptionally describe or list the reason(s) why you think this proposal is important.  This is important if any of the reasons aren’t in the Proposal Summary or a linked Subject Resource Description, and don’t already seem to be clearly evident to the [Eligible Voters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0HoLoNi4XK7RZT59zQl00hW9YF1CbQm-xrZ9AFXbPk/edit#heading=h.sreylt9m4swu).\
If you are proposing a major new Project or Resource, you may want to include a concise Reasons section here which is based on more extensive information in a linked Resource Description.\
Required ResourcesIndicate any important financial or material resources which would be required, of who, if the proposal succeeds.\
\
If you use this section, be precisely clear about who you’re proposing to be the responsible party/ies for providing each Required Resource.  (Especially if you’re proposing for the Base Project to provide it.)\
For very complex proposals, a complete budget and budgeting schedule may be developed.  (However, this should probably be developed in a Subject Project Summary.)\
Cost/Benefit AnalysisOptionally, for expensive proposals, add a subsection which compares the expected costs, benefits, risks and opportunities to each other.  (Hopefully, in a way which persuasively increases enthusiasm.)\
Roadmap/ Expected Indicators of SuccessHow will you, and we, know if the adopted proposal is successfully working?   Defining the indicators of success can be important for major Project proposals which require extensive research and development.  It can also be important for drafting Policies which might have complex or convoluted effects.\
If used, indicators of Success should include any intended metrics, milestones and reporting plans.    Note: if this proposal has one or more Subject Resources, such as a (draft) Project Summary, some or all of that information might be described there, instead of in the proposal.AppendicesProposal Submission FormWIP: link and summarize [Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r9uBz-329GCe7w-W7py9tn8atm-xKl9X09-2aDe86W8/edit?usp=sharing) if you develop that, and if it seems helpful hereA1For example, “We will get an Equal Rights Amendment passed” vs. “We will get 50,000 signatures on this ERA petition.”  (The former is especially unpredictable and uncertain.)  When drafting proposals, consider the relationship of simplicity to practicality.  Sometimes it’s important to create big co-creative dreaming, brainstorming and sensemaking spaces together; sometimes it’s more important to focus upon realistic and important (although sometimes unglamorous) goals with clearly demonstrable success or failure.\
A2For example, the Stewards of Project A might automatically be the Stewards of Spreadsheet 3 and Task X which is externally linked to that spreadsheet; etcetera.\
A3The implicit right of subprojects and Roles to self-organize never absolves them of accountability for following all associated Base Project policies, including a subproject charter or Role Summary (if the Extension has one).\
