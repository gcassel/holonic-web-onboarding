# Project Formatting

## Overview

### Title

### Description

_add 1-3 sentence concise description of the project_

### Vision

Vision is an optional but often important part of sensemaking to develop a [Mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vr957QAuU88YwXFXtoIrXocIDwXCtbpWWY4aRZQapXk/edit#heading=h.4lhuhh5vqf0d) (and the rest of a Project).  Vision is a goal; itâ€™s a desired state/condition of being and/or activity.  Vision can be grand and inspiring, as long as it leads to a practical Mission.

### Mission

_What is the_ [_primary_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) __ [_goal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) _which_ [_defines_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) _your_ [_project_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md)_?_ &#x20;

Mission should define, or summarize and link, the primary goal or goals for the Project. The mission is of utmost importance for defining and maintaining the integrity of the project.

_Mission should be identifiable as action, or activity, in which this project either maintains or further develops the resources of interest to the project stewards and others.  Mission may be perceived as vision, purpose, intent or goal.)_

### Summary

_A summary is a detailed overview which concisely represents your project at a reduced level of detail._

_(guidelines or rules on summary length TBD?)_

### Storyline

_-- Explain how your mission will serve all, and add value to the evolution of life on our planet._

_(Narrative/_ how it connects to nature/ consciousness)

_(Let's focus on this when we import IO into this format)_

### Problem / Solution

_Can you describe your Project's Mission as the story of a key Problem and its Solution?_

### Product(Goods/ Services)

_What goods and services, if any, is your product offering or developing for access through one or more commons or marketplaces?_

#### _Current ?_

#### _Planned ?_

(describe or link prototypes and proposals?  can compare to Developmental Staging Recipe classifications, if desired)

#### Use Cases

_What are the intended uses of the goods and/or services you have created or are creating?_

_(Note: if products are separately listed, so should use-cases be)_

## _**Governance Resources**_

_Use the subsections below to provide general information on_ [_governance resources_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance-resource.md) _and planning._

### Policies

_State or link any official_ [_policies_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md) _which determine how the project is governed or otherwise developed._

### Project Map

_(if any; model & map of project's systems)_

### Development Timeline/ Roadmap

_Provide or link the timeline or roadmap for reaching project development milestones._

### Project and Task Management System

_Describe or (preferably) include or link whatever system(s) you use for managing the project, issues and tasks._

#### _**Issues**_

_**NOTE: Should we ask for all CC-related Issues to be submitted in Baserow, via a clear scope of mission (i.e. only indicate the issues which you need help with??)**_

* _**Crucial design issue: How can we create a network-wide Issues system which enables sovereign projects to self-organize their own Issues?**_
* &#x20;_**need to help projects to understand when to submit Issues, and also explicitly empower them to self-organize internal issues.**_

### Projects Needs / Bounties

_Describe or link any functions or tasks which your project needs external help in performing, or (if applicable) link your bounty system._ &#x20;

### Current Value Invested

_Describe or link the resources already invested in the project, including estimated person-hours of labor._

## Additional Media&#x20;

_Please link additional media resources which are officially associated with the project.  This should ideally include all public project media resources, and may include any private resources which you want to share in our network._

### White papers

_List and link your Project's white paper(s), if any._

### Diagrams

### _Publications_

_List and link key publications about your Project._

### _Budget (Placeholder) (flesh this out)_

### Directory

**CONSTRUCTION NOTES:** &#x20;

1. **provide guidelines for turning "project maps" into directories.**
2. _Explanatory Notes:_ A directory is a map which _provides_ _directions_ for _accessing_ _project-related_ _resources_ _and/or_ _agents_.  **(See** [**directory**](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/directory.md) **on Github.**
3. _**Add examples including Dewey Decimal System for an ID system based purely on numbering, and 2-3 other examples including digital directories**_
4. _**integrate CCF as needed here**_

### Repository

_Link and describe your Project's Repository._

#### **Definition**

_A_ repository is a digital media storage drive.  _(THIS is probably sufficiently accurate for consciouslyconcepted)_

_A repository_ is a [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [_persistently_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) __ [_stored_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) __ [_media_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) __ [_resources_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) with a [_common_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) __ [_system_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) _of_ [_governance_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md).  (PROBABLY DELETE??)

#### Examples

a physical storage cabinet, such as the cabinet where you keep your canned goods

any digital media storage drive, such as:&#x20;

* Hard Drive on a personal computer
* Google Drive or other cloud storage drive

### Database

_A database_ is a [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_data_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) _in a_ [_specific_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) __ [_format_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md).

_not a separate database, but should be an ID/tag in other mapping/database systems_

### Wiki

#### Definition

A _wiki_ is _a_ [_network_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) _of_ [_digital_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) __ [_documents_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md) _which are_ [_collaboratively_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaborate.md) __ [_authored_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/author.md) _and_ [_edited_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md), either within a [project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md) or by a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [sovereign](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sovereign.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).

Usually a long-term goal for major projects with many contributors. Eventually they can marry in a unified conceptual field.&#x20;
